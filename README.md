# ngrx-store
# Description
A Simple angular 2 app to demonstrate the usage of ngrx store.

The app demonstrates the the CRUD operations such as ADD,UPDATE and REMOVE.The application state is Movie. So opearations as Add Movie,Delete Movie and Update movie are performed. I have used Bootstrap 4 and ng-bootstrap for better UI.
